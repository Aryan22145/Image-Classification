# Image Classification Project

This project classifies images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model built with TensorFlow.

## Project Overview

This model classifies images into different categories using a dataset (e.g., CIFAR-10, custom dataset). The goal of this project is to apply deep learning techniques to achieve high classification accuracy.

## Features

- Data preprocessing
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- TensorFlow and Keras for model building
- Model evaluation and visualization

## Setup Instructions

### Clone the repository
